# Word-Ladder

The wordLadder function is designed to find the shortest word ladder between two given words 
(source and target), with the constraint that the words involved are exactly 5 letters long. 
A word ladder is a sequence of words where each adjacent pair of words differs by exactly one character.
This implementation ensures that the word ladder is found within a reasonable time frame by using breadth-first 
search and unordered maps for efficient storage and retrieval of graph-related information. /
